# Polyrhythm

WORK IN PROGRESS

A cross-platform music tool designed to help students learn to read rhythms in sheet music. Notably, this app offers something special that you can't find anywhere else -
the ability to practice polyrhythms (two contrasting rhythms occuring simultaneously). For example, it is common in piano music to have four beats played with one hand 
while playing three beats in the other hand. This can be a difficult concept to master, and even more complex polyrhythms exist. This app allows the user to practice the
rhythms, alone, without having to worry about the melody.

Built with React Native / Typescript.
